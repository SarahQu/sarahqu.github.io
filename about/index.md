Hi, my name is Jiaqing (a.k.a Sarah) Qu. I was born in Beijing and spent my first 18 years of life in this beautiful city.

In 2011, I went to Shanghai, where I got my bachelor degree in Software Engineering at Fudan University.

In 2015, I went to Carnegie Mellon University to keep studying Computer Science. And I just received my master degree in May 2017, YEEAH!

I will start my career (and new life) at A9.com as a software engineer. 

In part time, I am a fashion enthusiast, which, in other word, a huge shopaholic, LOL. Some new hobbies I would like to develop this year are reading 📖 and exercising 🏃.
