I've never been the type of person who likes to expose a lot on social network. I don't have the habit of writing diary either. In fact, I always find it hard to define myself, both explicitly and inplicitly (sometimes). Then why do I make the decision of setting up this blog? Cause I recently realized that being able to regard yourself in an relatively objective way is an essential skill in life (probably the key to happiness as well). And for being mature, you need to face your inmaturity. 

Hopefully I can keep this blog on :)
